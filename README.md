This repo contains all documents of relevance for my BSc research project.


## File structure

    Contains all code written as analysis for the project by yours truly. Descriptions of these Notebooks is available within the Notebooks themselves.

- `./SpaceFluff`

    Contains (unmodified) code previously written by Anna Lanteri (under MIT license, see https://github.com/hwiks/spacefluff), e.g. for creation of the dataframes to be analyzed in `./analysis`.

- `/catalogue`

    Contains code pertaining to the catalogues of LSB/UDG candidates within the Fornax cluster, like extraction of object names and relevant physical properties, which are to be used on conjunction with the SpaceFluff data as _ground truth_ and for quantitative analysis.

- `/sources`
    Contains links and blurbs pertaining to papers and other sources potentially relevant during the project and eventually for the accompanying thesis paper.
